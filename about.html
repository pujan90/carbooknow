            <p style="background-color:rosybrown"> Insurance can minimize your financial liability in the case of a catastrophe and give you peace of mind.
When shopping for insurance, it is important to assess your individual needs to determine what insurance(s) you will actually require.
The world is a dangerous and risky place. Various catastrophes can befall an individual, and we as a species survived thanks to pooled resources and knowledge – after all, the explosion of technology in the past century finds its foundations on previous work. A magnificent concept would be a mechanism to mitigate risk in some kind of pool, spreading the risk among participants, so no single party is left to carry a burden single-handedly. That mechanism is insurance.</p>
